**Abstract**

Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is a form of a group of diseases called transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE). CWD is a growing concern for the future of not only deer populations, but for all cervid species, including mule deer, elk, and moose. We wanted to explore publicly available data from state wildlife agencies of Minnesota and all states with confirmed cases of CWD. We looked at the geographic distribution of incidence and prevalence of CWD in both Minnesota and the Untied States as a whole.
